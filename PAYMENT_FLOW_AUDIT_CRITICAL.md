## Technical Issues Identified

### 🚨 **Critical Issues**

1. **Broken Subscription Navigation**
   ```typescript
   // Current broken implementation in executive-dashboard.tsx
   onSubscribe={(tier) => {
     console.log("Subscribing to:", tier); // ❌ Only logs
     goHome(); // ❌ Just goes home, no payment flow
     setShowSubscription(false);
   }}
   ```

2. **Missing Payment Handler Integration**
   - Subscription screen has no path to PaymentHandler component
   - No price ID mapping for tier selection
   - No state management for payment flow

3. **Inconsistent User Journey**
   - New users: Landing → Tier Selection → Payment ✅
   - Existing users: Dashboard → Subscription → ❌ Dead end

### ⚠️ **Secondary Issues**

4. **Price ID Mismatch Risk**
   - Frontend uses: `price_1S97NyBgt7hUXmS2a8tpOW6I` (Personal), `price_1S97ORBgt7hUXmS2JXVMb0tu` (Professional)
   - These IDs exist in Stripe ✅
   - But subscription screen doesn't use them ❌

5. **Missing Navigation Context**
   - No way to return to dashboard after payment
   - Users get lost in payment flow
